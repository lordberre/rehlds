# HLDS Docker dproto(47/48 Steam+noSteam)

## Half-Life Dedicated Server as a Docker image

Probably the fastest and easiest way to set up an old-school Half-Life
Deathmatch Dedicated Server (HLDS). Both Steam and noSteam, old and new
half-life clients can connect and play together! You don't need to know
anything about Linux or HLDS to start a server. You just need Docker and
this image.

## Quick Start

Start a new server by running:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -d -p27015:27015 -p27015:27015/udp artkirienko/hlds
```

Change the player slot size, map or `rcon_password` by running:

```
docker run -it --rm -d --name hlds -p27015:27015 -p27015:27015/udp artkirienko/hlds +map crossfire +maxplayers 12 +rcon_password SECRET_PASSWORD
```

> **Note:** Any [server config command](http://sr-team.clan.su/K_stat/hlcommandsfull.html)
  can be passed by using `+`. But it has to follow after the image name `artkirienko/hlds`.
